# Machine Learning Prediction Project
This Machine Learning Prediction project is part of Johns Hopkins University's course assignment requirement.

There are three other files in this repo:

- **PML.Rmd** which provides the R markdown code for the analysis.
- **PML.html**. Please note that Github could only display this in its raw HTML form. The rendered HTML can be viewed in the gh-pages branch or at this link: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tanishqsngl/Practical-Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/PML.html
